## Installation

1. To generate the config file for Elite-Dev-Bot, first run the jar, it will error out but it would have created a config file in the working directory.
2. Edit the config options for your own discord server, all of the values except the twitter keys are required!

## Contributing

1. Fork it!
2. Create your feature branch: `git checkout -b my-new-feature`
3. Commit your changes: `git commit -am 'Add some feature'`
4. Push to the branch: `git push origin my-new-feature`
5. Submit a pull request :D

## History

Elite Developer Bot was created because a server I was active in needed some specific features and we couldn't find any other bots with the exact feature we wanted.
